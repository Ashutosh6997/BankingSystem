This Banking System Android App is my first project using Google's Firebase Realtime Database.

It allows users to Sign Up using their credentials and use some common functionalities of any general Banking app. 
When a user Sign's Up in the app, they are credited with â‚¹1000 as a Sign Up bonus and then they can transfer this amount to any other user who has valid Email-ID and is also a already Signed Up user of this app.

This displays how real time transactions can be done between two entities.

The beautifully laid out interface allows us to view all the transactions that a user have done in a nice tabular format.

Other than these, there as some simple things too, such as "Bill Payment" and "Recharge" options which are just dummy demonstrations of the concept, because in the back end the money is just debited from your account and shown in the transaction history.

This was my Project for Bachelors of Science in Computer Science.

I hope that this project would be useful for other students too who want to learn Android app development using some real project.
